Zentigrity Transaction Types
1. GrievanceRegistry (Submit Grievance)

Trigger: Citizen submits grievance (wallet auth).

On-chain: Stores grievance ID + timestamp.

Off-chain (MongoDB): Stores full grievance details (description, media, AI tags).

Output: grievanceId created.

✅ Example:
Alice reports “Pothole near school” → IPFS hash stored → grievanceId = #101.

2. submitBid (Worker Bid Submission)

Trigger: Worker submits bid for an open grievance.

On-chain: Worker address + bid amount + grievanceId.

Off-chain: Stores details in MongoDB (time_to_resolve, experience, comments).

Output: Bid list tied to grievance.

✅ Example:
Worker Bob bids 120 AVAX / 6 hours for grievance #101.

3. TaskAssignment (DAO Assigns Task)

Trigger: DAO or auto-assignment picks best bid.

On-chain: Records grievanceId → assignedWorker.

Dashboard: DAO UI shows assigned worker for each grievance.

Output: Worker locked for task.

✅ Example:
DAO assigns grievance #101 to Bob. DAO dashboard shows “Task #101 → Assigned to Bob (Wallet 0x1234)”.

4. workComplete (Task Resolution Proof)

Trigger: Assigned worker submits completion proof (photo/video on IPFS).

On-chain: Updates status grievanceId → completed.

Off-chain: MongoDB stores IPFS link + timestamp.

Output: Ready for escrow release.

✅ Example:
Bob uploads photo of fixed pothole → status = Completed.

5. EscrowManager (Funds Release)

Trigger: Citizen + DAO confirm resolution.

On-chain: Escrow releases AVAX to worker (minus fee).

Off-chain: MongoDB updates grievance status = Resolved.

Output: Worker gets paid, grievance closed.

✅ Example:
120 AVAX locked → 117 AVAX paid to Bob, 3 AVAX platform fee.

🎯 Final Flow

Citizen → GrievanceRegistry (submit grievance)

Workers → submitBid (bids stored on-chain + MongoDB)

DAO → TaskAssignment (assign best bid)

Worker → workComplete (upload proof)

EscrowManager (release funds)

🖥️ DAO Dashboard (Minimal Requirements)
 create  a page 
List of all grievances (grievanceId, description, status).

For each grievance:

Assigned worker + wallet address.

Current status (Open, Assigned, Completed, Resolved).

Voting/proposals (if DAO voting enabled).

Ability for DAO/citizens to confirm completion → triggers EscrowManager.
i also want the rupee conversion of avax like the bid should be submitted in rupee and the avax equivalent of that rupee should be used in transaction
